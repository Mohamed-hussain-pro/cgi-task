# CGI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

## Development server

Run the database `json-server --watch db.json`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

Coding Challenge: Data Visualization
A company wants a front-end application for temperature monitoring
of its production machines can be developed.
You should develop a dashboard for this application, which shows the most important
information is presented clearly. This information includes:
• The average temperature of all machines over time
• The readings for individual machines over time
• A listing of all measurements where a value of 90 was exceeded
The temperature curves are to be presented in the form of interactive diagrams ("charts").
be visualized and the observation in the time periods week, month and year
make possible.
When listing the critical measured values, the measurement date, the name
of the machine in question and the temperature value are displayed.
The measurement data for the visualization can be taken from the db.json file in the attachments
become. The data should be retrieved from your application using a REST API. You
For example, you can use the freely available JSON server locally (npm install json-server).
The start page should also contain a navigation bar, which is next to the attached
CGI Logo the (dummy) navigation elements Dashboard, Machines and Measurements as well
includes a logout button.
Also note that the application is designed for use on both desktop and
mobile devices should be aligned. In the attachments you will find two examples
Sketches for the layout of the dashboard. You are also welcome to deviate from this.
We ask you to use JavaScript as the programming language, the choice of framework is up to you
leave.
Good luck!


The average temperature of all machines over time ???
